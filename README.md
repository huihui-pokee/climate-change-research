# Climate Change Research Findings

Here's a summary of recent climate change research findings:

## General Impacts and Trends

*   **Global Warming:** The Earth's climate has already warmed by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900 due to human emissions of heat-trapping gases. The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C within the next few decades. Summer of 2023 was the Earth's hottest summer on record.
*   **Extreme Weather:** Climate change is causing more frequent and intense extreme weather events across the globe. Asia, in particular, is experiencing increasing impacts from extreme weather, alternating between droughts and floods.
*   **Sea Level Rise:** Since 1880, the global sea level has risen by about 8 inches (0.2 meters). Projections estimate that by 2100, it could rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), and possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level rise is due to melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.
*   **Irreversible Changes:** Melting glaciers and sea level rise, which reached record levels in 2022, will continue for thousands of years.

## Specific Impacts

*   **Wildfires:** Human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase significantly.
*   **Rainfall:** Climate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation.
*   **Agriculture:** Climate change has altered growing conditions for the world's major crops, reshaping agriculture. Heat and drought are negatively impacting crop yields.
*   **Ecosystems:** Changes are being observed in ecosystems, including shrinking glaciers and ice sheets, earlier breakup of river and lake ice, shifting plant and animal geographic ranges, and earlier blooming of plants and trees.
*   **Air Quality:** Human-caused climate change led to additional early deaths from wildfire air pollution in the continental United States.

## Recent studies

*   **Flooding:** Climate change made recent flooding in the Midwest and South of the US more intense. Record-breaking downpours were made about 9% heavier due to human-caused global warming.
*   **Sinking Cities:** All of the biggest U.S. cities are sinking to one degree or another, including those on the coasts and in the interior.
*   **Glacier Ice Piracy:** A glacier in Antarctica is stealing ice from a neighbor, a phenomenon that has never been observed in such a short time frame.

## Future Projections

*   **Temperature Rise:** There is a greater than 50% chance that global temperature rise will reach or surpass 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) between 2021 and 2040. Under a high-emissions pathway, this threshold could be reached even sooner.
*   **Insurance Costs:** Homeowners in high-risk areas are already seeing their insurance costs rise sharply as companies adjust to the growing risk.

## Mitigation and Adaptation

*   **Emissions Reduction:** To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed. This requires a rapid shift away from burning fossil fuels.
*   **Adaptation:** Adaptation measures can effectively build resilience, but more finance is needed to scale solutions.
